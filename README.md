# **OpenAlex4Gephi**
The OpenAlex4Gephi project is a project that allows a user to fetch network data from openalex.org in Gephi format via its API. The network data is a bimodal network of authors to publications. The network nodes and edges data are collected and stored as separate CSV files, which can be downloaded to your local machine and then imported into Gephi for visualization and analysis.
